# Contributing to Awesome Shields
+ The main idea is to add some more style to the shields, while keeping them informative.
+ We do not hardcode the output of the right part, just the color (if needed).
+ Shield source should start with *img.shields.io*.
+ We can specify *alt* and *source*, but not the *href*.
+ The *source* link can link to the actual project, but there should not be a link, just leave empty parentheses.

# Example of proper addition
```

**Contribution guidelines are "young", because the project has just started, therefore there might be some changes in the future.**
